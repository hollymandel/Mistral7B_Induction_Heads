This is a repo to locate <a href = "https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html">induction heads</a> in Mistral 7B (ih_sweep.ipynb) and then study the impact of ablating them on a question-answering task (`ih_babi.ipynb`). The dictionaries ih_evaluators.pkl and ih_scores.pkl contain the output of ih_sweep.ipynb, and ih_scores.pkl is necessary to run ih_babi.pynb. See the notebooks for more detailed explanation.
